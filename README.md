# Healthcare UX & Process Optimization: Pharmacy Queuing System Improvement
**Case Study: China Medical University Hospital - Cancer Center Pharmacy**

## 📌 Project Overview
 During my internship at China Medical University Hospital, I led a project to optimize the outpatient pharmacy's queuing flow. The project addressed frequent patient complaints regarding chaotic queuing, line-cutting, and unclear display systems. By applying **Queuing Theory** and **Data-Driven Research**, I proposed and implemented solutions that improved overall patient satisfaction.

## 📊 Research Methodology: Quantitative & Qualitative Insight
To ensure a data-driven approach, I conducted a comprehensive two-phase survey study:

* **Survey Design:** Developed a structured questionnaire covering 10 key metrics, including queueing flow, display visibility, and overall satisfaction.
    * **English Version:** [English Survey](media/問卷(english).pdf)
    * **Chinese Version:** [Chinese Survey](media/癌症大樓藥局滿意度問卷.pdf)

* **Measurement:** Utilized a **5-point Likert Scale** (1 = Very Dissatisfied to 5 = Very Satisfied) to quantify subjective patient experiences.
* **Sample Selection:** Conducted random sampling of 100+ outpatients (50 pre-test and 50 post-test) at the Cancer Center Pharmacy.
* **Demographic Targeting:** Identified that 22% of respondents were seniors aged 65 or above, emphasizing the need for high-contrast signage and intuitive icons.

</p>

* **User Experience Baseline:** Found that 81% of respondents were returning patients, providing a reliable sample for longitudinal comparison.

* **Gap Analysis:** Analyzed open-ended feedback to identify "hidden" pain points, such as patients being unaware they needed to complete payment before queueing for medication.

## 🔴 Problem Identification
Through the initial research phase, I identified three primary drivers of dissatisfaction:
1. **Psychological Anxiety:** Patients felt "uncertain waits" were longer than "known waits" due to unclear display logic.
2. **Operational Gaps:** Lack of volunteer guidance during peak hours led to line-cutting disputes.
3. **Physical Constraints:** Limited seating and vertical window lines caused crowding and social distancing concerns.

## 🛠 Strategic Solutions
I developed a phased roadmap for optimization:
* **Short-term:** Redesigned bilingual signage with vivid icons and clear instructions ("Do not queue before your number is called").
* **Mid-term:** Increased volunteer deployment during peak hours to manage flow.
* **Long-term:** Designed a multi-screen integrated calling system to sync pharmacy numbers with hallway TVs, allowing patients to wait comfortably in seating areas.

## 📈 Key Results & Impact
The data-driven approach led to measurable improvements in patient experience:

| Research Metric (Satisfaction Mean) | Pre-test | Post-test | Delta |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Display Quantity Satisfaction** | 3.98 | **4.20** | **+0.22** |
| **Waiting Time Satisfaction** | 3.78 | **3.98** | **+0.20** |
| **Overall Experience Satisfaction** | 4.18 | **4.32** | **+0.14** |

*Note: While physical wait times remained constant, the "Perceived Wait Time" improved significantly through better communication and distraction (educational videos).*
